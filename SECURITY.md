# Security Documentation

## Overview
This application implements comprehensive security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.

## Security Features

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- **Supabase Auth Integration**: Secure user authentication with email/password
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Database-level access control ensuring users can only access their own data
- **Session Management**: Automatic token refresh and secure session handling

### 2. Data Protection
- **Encrypted Storage**: All sensitive data is encrypted at rest in Supabase
- **Secure Transmission**: All API calls use HTTPS/TLS encryption
- **Input Validation**: Client and server-side validation prevents malicious input

### 3. Audit Logging
- **Comprehensive Tracking**: All CRUD operations are logged with:
  - User ID
  - Timestamp
  - Table name
  - Record ID
  - Action type (create, update, delete, status_update)
  - Old and new values
- **Immutable Logs**: Audit logs cannot be modified or deleted by users
- **Privacy Compliant**: Only necessary data is logged

### 4. Rate Limiting & Monitoring
- **Login Attempts**: Maximum 5 failed login attempts per 15-minute window
- **API Operations**: Maximum 50 operations per minute per user
- **Security Event Logging**: Failed attempts and suspicious activities are tracked
- **Automatic Blocking**: Temporary blocks after rate limit violations

### 5. Database Security
- **RLS Policies**: Every table has appropriate Row Level Security policies
- **User Isolation**: Users can only access data they own
- **Secure Functions**: Database functions use `SECURITY DEFINER` with proper search paths
- **Validated Inputs**: All database operations include validation triggers

## Security Policies

### Row Level Security Policies

#### Bills Table
- Users can view, create, update, and delete only their own bills
- All operations require authentication (`auth.uid()`)

#### Suppliers Table  
- Users can view, create, update, and delete only their own suppliers
- All operations require authentication (`auth.uid()`)

#### Banks Table
- Users can view, create, update, and delete only their own banks
- All operations require authentication (`auth.uid()`)

#### Supplier Types Table
- Users can view, create, update, and delete only their own supplier types
- All operations require authentication (`auth.uid()`)

#### Audit Logs Table
- Users can view only their own audit logs
- Users can insert audit logs only for their own actions
- Update and delete operations are prohibited

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Never bypass RLS**: Always use authenticated requests
2. **Validate all inputs**: Check data on both client and server side
3. **Use semantic tokens**: Follow design system color usage
4. **Log sensitive operations**: Use the audit logging system
5. **Handle errors securely**: Don't expose internal system details

### For Users
1. **Strong passwords**: Use complex, unique passwords
2. **Secure sessions**: Log out when finished
3. **Monitor activity**: Review audit logs regularly
4. **Report issues**: Contact support for suspicious activity

## Security Monitoring

### Automated Monitoring
- Failed login attempts are tracked and rate-limited
- Excessive API usage triggers temporary blocks
- Security events are logged for review
- Database violations are automatically prevented

### Manual Review
- Audit logs provide complete operation history
- Security events can be reviewed in browser storage
- Database logs are available in Supabase dashboard

## Incident Response

### Security Event Detection
1. **Automated Detection**: Rate limiting and validation prevent most attacks
2. **Manual Detection**: Review audit logs and security events
3. **User Reports**: Users can report suspicious activity

### Response Procedures
1. **Immediate**: Automatic rate limiting and blocking
2. **Investigation**: Review logs and determine scope
3. **Mitigation**: Additional blocks or policy updates if needed
4. **Recovery**: Reset affected accounts if necessary

## Compliance

### Data Protection
- **LGPD/GDPR Ready**: User data isolation and audit trails
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect necessary information
- **User Rights**: Users control their own data
- **Retention**: Audit logs maintained for compliance

### Security Standards
- **Encryption**: TLS 1.3 for transmission, AES-256 for storage
- **Authentication**: Industry-standard JWT tokens
- **Authorization**: Principle of least privilege
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive audit trails

## Security Updates

### Regular Maintenance
- Dependencies are kept up to date
- Security patches applied promptly
- Regular security reviews conducted
- Policies updated as needed

### Reporting Issues
If you discover a security vulnerability, please:
1. Do not disclose publicly
2. Contact the development team immediately
3. Provide detailed reproduction steps
4. Allow time for investigation and patching
